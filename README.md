# Portfolio Website
Deployed with Netlify, which is my first website and domain. I had to learn how to deploy through netlify which was suprisingly easy.
Followed a tutorial by Slobodan on Youtube for ideas, but then broke everything to customize it the way that I like and with my information.
I created my portfolio in React because I wanted to learn the latest technology and house my projects for job applications.
First time using scss, learned quickly and made it easy to build responsiveness into my pages.

## Cool Features
- Responsive
- Map of my general location (Seattle)
- Contact Form that connects to my email
- Letter animation
- rotating cube

## Future implementations
- Add in background animations for the background
- One page scroll to then deploy on github pages to save money
